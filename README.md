This repository demonstrates a subtle error in Java exception handling. The `UncommonError.java` file contains code that throws an `ArithmeticException`.  The `catch` block re-throws the exception as a `RuntimeException`, adding extra context. The `finally` block executes regardless, potentially accessing resources that might have been released in the `catch` block. This can lead to unpredictable behaviour and is an uncommon but significant error type. The solution, provided in `UncommonErrorSolution.java`, demonstrates better exception handling techniques to mitigate this.
